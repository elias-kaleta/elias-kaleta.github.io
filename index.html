      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="textbox">I'm a digital enthusiast who has recently graduated with a degree in Creative Technology from AUT. Through my university work and recent internship, 
        I have found that I love working across a range of areas within Digital, and I am able to easily adapt to any team or situation. I'm half Samoan, 
        half Greek. Outside of work, I have a really broad range of interests and love trying new things!
        A common question is what does a Bachelor of Creative Technology entail? The answer is not simple, because it encompasses a key trait that also describes 
        my skillset, ambiguity. Both myself and the degree have a multi-disciplinary scope - Product design (Digital and Physical), entrepreneurship, coding and 
        just creating in general. Throughout my professional and academic career, I have gained a vast range of skills. My 7 years in retail taught me communication 
        and people skills; my 3 years studying Creative Technology taught me product design and fabrication, UX/UI design, market research, and how to work in a 
        team-based project; my Creative Media certificate solidified my knowledge of design and the use of most Adobe Suite programs.
        If you're looking for an individual with a multi-faceted skillset and the ability to adapt to whatever is thrown at them, look no further.</p>
