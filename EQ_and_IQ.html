        <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
        <p>Emotional Quotient (EQ) or Emotional inteligence refers to one's own ability to recognise, process and manage one's own and others' emotions. 
          Someone with high emotional inteligence is able to effectively control or manage their own emotions and possesses high 
          empathy when dealing with other people's emotions. This factor is a key part in varying parts of our lives including:
          <ul>
            <li>Creating and maintaining healthy interpersonal relationships </li>
            <li>Personal development</li>
            <li>Professional and career development</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to understand that emotional inteligence levels can vary between individuals. It is highly dependant
          on an individuals environment (both current and past). Emotional inteligence is also valued or rated differently in different
          cultures and religions.
        </p>
        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          Inteligence Quotient (IQ) is a measurement of an individual's cognitive and intellectual skills. This includes skills like problem solving, analytical
          thinking and memory retention. Just because someone has a high IQ, it does not imply a high EQ and vice versa. It is actually a common conception that 
          individuals with a high IQ tend to have low EQ but most studies only suggest a week correlation between the two with many exceptions.
          <br><br>
          Here are some use cases for the different quotients:

        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>
          Having a high EQ can be very beneficial for a happier life. It can mean:
          <ul>
            <li>Stronger relationships - Higher EQ can help in communication, conflict resolution and empathy to others.</li>
            <li>Stronger leadership abilities - High EQ leaders are often better at motivating and mitigating interpersonal issues.</li>
            <li>Less stress - If you have a higher EQ, you are more likely to know how to process and manage your emotions and responses in high stress situations</li>
            <li>Stronger sense of self-worth - Higher EQ often means better self-awareness and self-regulation, often leading to a higher quality of life.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence is a powerful quality to possess. It helps you to navigate all the different emotional and mental curveballs life may throw at you. 
            My goal for this year is to become more emotionally intelligent - albeit I consider myself to already have an acceptable EQ, I lack it when it comes to self-actualisation.
            This is why EQ is often broken into four types: 
            <ul>
              <li>Self Awareness</li>
              <li>Self Management</li>
              <li>Social Awareness</li>
              <li>Relationship Management</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            It is easy to excel in some areas and neglect others. Next time you find yourself emotionally distraught, pay attention to how you react and your actions and analyse how 
            the above types of EQ relate to the consequences - it can be quite eye-opening.
