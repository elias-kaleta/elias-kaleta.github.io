        CSS has different types of positioning depending on your specific layout
        needs. Three of the main types are fixed, relative and absolute. 
        <ul id="position-list">
          <li>
            Fixed positioning means the element will be positioned relative to the viewport
            as opposed to the elements around it. When used, it will stay fixed to the
            specific location it is placed in and will not move as the user scrolls.
            This type is often used for elements like navigation bars that you want to
            remain visible at all times. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Absolute positioning means the element is
            placed relative to its parent element. This means that the element is
            removed from the normal flow of the page and can overlap other elements.
            If the element has no parent or the parent is not positioned, the absolute
            element will move alot with the page scrolling. This positioning type is
            good for creating overlays or popups. 
          </li>
          <li> 
            Relative positioning means that the
            elements position is relative to its normal position on the webpage. This
            means you can move the element from its normal position using directional
            properties (such as top, right, bottom, and left) and other content will
            not be adjusted to fit into any gaps left by the element. This is a
            position type which is often used for positioning an element when you do
            not want to affect the layout of other elements.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Below are some examples of the different positioning in action!</p>
        <div id="fixed-element">This is a fixed element (scroll and I will follow u hehe)</div>
        <br>
        <div id="relative-element">Hey I'm a relative element. I have 100px padding on my left but that's still my space so no one else can take it.</div>
        <div id="placeholder">Hey, I'm an ancestor of absolute element, I have a 600 px left padding.
          <div id="absolute-element">Hey! I'm an absolute element, the text above is my parent! I don't have any padding but I'm sticking with my parent</div>    
        </div>
        <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  
      </p>
      <!-- <div style="height:1000px";></div> -->
    </section>
  </body>
  <footer><a href="#top">Back to top hehe</a></footer>
