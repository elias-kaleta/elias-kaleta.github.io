       <h3> My experience with a 'simple' problem:</h3>
        <p>I was working on this JavaScript function that was supposed to make the first letter of each word in a sentence uppercase. Seemed pretty straightforward, 
          right? Well, not exactly.<br><br>
          I was told to use this thing called a .map function to do the letter conversions. But here's the thing – I just couldn't figure out how to use it. It felt like I was going in circles, 
          thinking a simple for loop or forEach loop would have been easier. That frustration crept in as I hit a wall.
          I tried looking at the documentation, but it just made me more confused. The more I tried to apply the map function, the more annoyed I got. <br><br>
          Eventually, I gave up and turned to YouTube for help. After watching a short 3-minute video, everything suddenly made sense. The syntax of the map function 
          clicked, and I finished the task with a sense of relief. It felt good to finally get it, but I also felt a bit silly for struggling for so long.<br><br>
          This whole experience taught me something important. While written guides are helpful, sometimes a video tutorial can be a game-changer, especially for tricky concepts. 
          It's all about finding what works best for you and making coding a little less of a headache.</p>


        <h3>My experience with an 'elegant' problem.</h3>
        <p>I encountered a challenge that required adding each student from an array to a gradebook object. The catch? The student's name had to be the key, with an empty object 
          as the value. As I delved into the task, I stumbled upon the dilemma of referencing a key in an object within a for loop. I got confused on whether to use dot notation 
          or square brackets. Turning to the internet for answers proved to be a maze of its own, as I didn’t know what I didn’ know!<br><br>
          Frustrated but determined, I decided to seek assistance from a friend. And oh boy, what a difference it made! With a bit of human interaction and a fresh perspective, 
          my confusion melted away in no time. It hit me that sometimes, the quickest path to clarity is through a simple conversation with someone who can provide personalized
           guidance. <br><br>This experience left me with a powerful lesson in the art of problem-solving. Elegant solutions often emerge not from endless online quests but from the 
           collaborative spirit of seeking help from others. So, don't shy away from reaching out for a helping hand when you hit a coding roadblock.</p>
