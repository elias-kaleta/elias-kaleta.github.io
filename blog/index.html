        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>
          This is from LinkedIn, I do not talk about myself like this normally
          &lt;3
        </h3>
        <p>
          I'm a digital enthusiast who has recently graduated with a degree in
          Creative Technology from AUT. Through my university work and recent
          internship, I have found that I love working across a range of areas
          within Digital, and I am able to easily adapt to any team or
          situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm half Samoan, half Greek. Outside of work, I have a really broad
          range of interests and love trying new things! A common question is
          what does a Bachelor of Creative Technology entail? The answer is not
          simple, because it encompasses a key trait that also describes my
          skillset, ambiguity. Both myself and the degree have a
          multi-disciplinary scope - Product design (Digital and Physical),
          entrepreneurship, coding and just creating in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my professional and academic career, I have gained a vast
          range of skills. My 7 years in retail taught me communication and
          people skills; my 3 years studying Creative Technology taught me
          product design and fabrication, UX/UI design, market research, and how
          to work in a team-based project; my Creative Media certificate
          solidified my knowledge of design and the use of most Adobe Suite
          programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're looking for an individual with a multi-faceted skillset and
          the ability to adapt to whatever is thrown at them, look no further.
