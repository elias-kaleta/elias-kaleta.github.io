        <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>

        <h3>What is neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>Neuroplasticity is a relatively new concept in neuroscience that highlights the brain's ability to be flexible and adapt throughout its lifespan. This concept enables our brains
          to compensate for injury and illness (such as ADHD, autism, depression, etc.), adjust to new experiences and challenges and manage overall cognitive function. 
        </p>

        <h3>What are the principles and how can I benefit from them?</h3>
        <div class="grid-neuro">
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>1. Use It or Lose It</h3>
            <p>Every thought or action uses specific 'connections' in your brain. The less common the action/throught, the weaker the connection (more mental effort required). Engage in continuous 
              learning and acquire new skills to challenge your brain and form new neural connections. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>3. Salience</h3>
            <p>Meaningful or emotionally significant experiences have a greater impact on neuroplasticity compared to routine or mundane activities. Connect new information or skills to existing 
              knowledge to make learning more meaningful and memorable.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>5. Intensity</h3>
            <p>Your brain is a muscle, higher intensity exercises are more likely to propel the strengthening of these pathways. Push yourself beyond your comfort zone to stimulate greater
               neural activity and adaptation.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>7. Age</h3>
            <p>The brain can change and adapt at any age, not just during childhood or specific developmental stages.Stay mentally active and engaged 
              in learning opportunities to support brain health and plasticity as you age. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>9. Transference</h3>
            <p>Learning in one domain is often applicable in other domains so these connections are often transferable between habits/pathways. Look for ways to generalize newly acquired 
              skills to real-life scenarios for maximum impact.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>2. Use It and Improve It</h3>
            <p>Practice makes perfect! The more you practice something, the more these connections grow and stronger they get. Use brain-training exercises and activities like puzzles, 
              crosswords, or memory games to stimulate different areas of the brain.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>4. Repetition</h3>
            <p>Consistent repetition of activities or behaviors can reinforce neural connections and promote lasting changes in the brain. Practice new skills regularly to facilitate the 
              formation of strong neural pathways associated with those skills.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>6. Specificity</h3>
            <p> Different experiences can lead to changes in specific neural pathways, resulting in targeted improvements in certain skills or abilities. Tailor your brain-training exercises
               to address areas where you seek enhancement for more targeted neuroplastic effects.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>8. Time</h3>
            <p>Your brain will more or less strengthen a pathway regardless of the timing but there are windows of time where progress is made at a faster rate (E.g, younger vs older, morning vs night).
              Be patient and persistent in your efforts to see the benefits of neuroplasticity unfold over time.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="grid-item">
            <h3>10. Interference</h3>
            <p>The brain is always learning and strengthening/weakening these pathways regardless on if it is a good/bad action. This can interfere with positive changes you want to make.
              Create a conducive environment for learning and brain training by reducing external interferences.
            </p>
          </div>

        <p>By understanding neuroplasticity, a person increases their level of self-actualisation (the realisation of one's own potenital) - something everyone should strive for.
          The world around us is forever changing, there's new technologies, social constructs and societal structures. As we grow older, we tend to stop learning new things and stick
        to our defaults which can lead to a decline in our neuroplasticity. By understanding this term and its principles, we are able to be more proactive with our choices to ensure
      we are actively using our brains in a way that optimises its neuroplasticity - offering a life of constant growth and adaptivitiy. </p>

        <h2>Growth Mindset and how it relates to neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>A growth mindset is a belief that abilities and Inteligence are able to all be developed through hard work and preserverence. An example of someone with a growth mindset would be
          an individual who sees challenges as opportunities for development as opposed to obstacles blocking their progress. This type of mindset has a caffeine effect on neuroplastic changes.
          A person who possesses a growth mindset fosters a positive attitude towards challenges which stimulates neruplastic growth.By cultivating a growth mindset, individuals are more likely to 
          adopt behaviors and strategies that support neuroplasticity, leading to enhanced cognitive function, increased resilience, and improved overall well-being.

        <h2>How will I implement these concepts moving forward?</h2>
        <p>I took a few psychology classes at uni so I am fairly familiar with neuroplasticity. I have always been curious of how our minds work ever since I was a young teen (Anyone remember Lumosity?).
          Stoicism is a philosophy that I try to implement into my approach to life (Within reason of course, I am still quite an emotional person). Stoicism, in plain terms, encourages suppression of
          passions and strong emotion in favour of living a simple life. I find that my use of this philosophy is quite comparable to a growth mindset.
          <br><br>
          When I say I use it in my approach to life, I mean I often filter how I express my emotions in situations I feel they may not
          lead to any productive progress (Example being listening during an argument, processing then responding as opposed to a quick-fire back and forth). What this mindset allows me to do is
          very similar to a growth mindset, while I may complain to myself about a task that is challenging, I still follow through with it because sitting and complaining will not get me anywhere. A popular
          quote related to stocism is, 'It's not what happens to you that matters, It is how you react' - Growth and development can occur simply by experiencing something but what propels such growth forward 
          and ensures it sticks is what we do as a reaction to it. 
          <br><br>
          This has already come into practice quite a lot for this course. I personally prefer to get straight into practical learning as opposed to theory (or in this case the core sections) which may in part
          be due to my ADHD. But I recognise that the core sections of the course are just as much a part of learning as the tech sections so though I may feel unmotivated to complete it, I push the irritance
          aside and complete what is expected from me. I have already noticed that my brain is getting used to this workflow as it takes me a lot less mental effort to initiate the core section work. I also 
          think that the core sections being moved to the start of the sprint works better for me as I am more inclined to do it first as opposed to the end of the week where I am just focusing on the weekend.
          <br><br>
