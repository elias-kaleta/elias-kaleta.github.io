        <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          Following this course, I’m hoping to land a entry-level/graduate position in any of the following fields: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Web Development (Preferably Frontend)</li>
          <li>UX/UI Design</li>
          <li>CX Specialist</li>
          <li>Product Design/Project Management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My goal is to find a long-term company that offers a role in the above fields with good career progression. I don’t intend on jumping between companies but would prefer to find one where I have an ongoing opportunity for professional growth.
        </p>
        
        <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
        <p>
          Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic, distance learning has become the norm for most learning environments. I have become confident in ensuring my work gets done on time but I still rely on the need for a deadline to motivate progress as opposed to working solely off self-initiative. This weakness has been evident in my experience during foundations as I would get halfway through the week and realise that I have not made much progress.
          A strength of mine is definitely my vast experience in studying. I have studied a lot of different courses with all different teaching styles and have learned which styles are most efficient for me. This works well for me for foundations as the handbook is my go to for learning competencies and I am able to pick what I want to learn and find other ways to learn it as opposed to some of the proposed material in the handbook. An example of this is some of the long videos in the sprints are a bit difficult for me to watch and absorb as I have ADHD. I will often 2x the speed, try and take mental notes of the main topics, try out the exercises or executing the section’s competencies and if I get confused, refer back to the specific part of the video or find solutions online. This method stops me from becoming disinterested as I am learning hands-on and being more active throughout the process (as opposed to trying to sustain attention to a long video).
        </p>
        
        <h2>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
        <p>
          I would like to furhter develop my human skills of communication, teamwork and creativity in a project environment.
        </p>
        
        <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>I commit to not over-promise myself in projects which often leads to underdelivering. </li>
            <li>I also commit to ensuring my part of each project is done to the best of my ability and offering support when others need it (only if I have the time to do so). </li>
            <li>I commit to only offering feedback when asked by the person and ensuring it is considerate and constructive.</li>
            <li>I commit to working alongside others timelines and  compromising when possible. I understand we are all at different levels and have external responsibilities.</li>
            <li>I commit to trying to solve my own confusions before I reach out to a facilitator for further clarification.</li>
            <li>I Communication can be scary but it is a very important part of teamwork. I will try my best to be open and realistic about my capacity and capabilities in cases where they may affect my coursework.</li>
          </ul>
        
        <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
        <p>
        I have found that it helps to commit myself to a short amount of work each day which often leads to me getting more done as it’s initiating the work that is the hardest part. I also find it helpful to set my own deadlines to ensure I stay on track (Like setting plans for the weekends so I have motivation to complete my week’s sprint beforehand) 
        </p>
        <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
        <p>
        My expectations of them is that of what a student would typically expect of a teaching team. I would appreciate:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>An environment where questions are welcomed. </li>
          <li>A lot of opportunities to request feedback on work to ensure it is of quality and up to standard.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
        <p>
          I am pretty free schedule-wise besides the occasional need to pick up my brother from school around 3pm on weekdays.
