      <h1>Relfecting on Human Skills</h1>
      <p>
        The thing that surprised me the most about the human skills learning
        modules was realising how much exposure I have had to a lot of the
        content in the past I think growing up I often found myself only being
        able to speak to myself about things I was feeling or experiencing so I
        would often find myself researching into psychology and the reasoning
        behind why I was feeling a certain way which often led me to quite a few
        of the concepts that we have gone through on these human skills modules.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is for this reason that I feel pretty confident in my current
        knowledge on emotional intelligence and a growth mindset, but I am
        definitely aware of my lack of skill in listening and looping which part
        I feel relates to my ADHD.
      </p>

      <p>
        These all tie into my own personal values of not wanting to hinge on
        other people's issues with my own and try to decipher things on my own
        instead of reaching out to others which I feel is very visible in my
        learning process and workflows during these past sprints. I feel going
        over these concepts again has helped me in realising my pitfalls and I
        do feel like I have been getting better and reaching out for help when
        needed but definitely need to work on it more during the boot camp.
      </p>

      <h3>
        What are some new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
        to the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        I've come to realise that I try to be self sufficient to a fault. I
        previously wrote about how I try to follow stocism but its become clear
        that this leads to rather self-destructive habits which hinder my
        efficiency and at times, my motivation. This also emphasised how my ego
        encourages me to help others but not accept help from them. I overthink
        it to the point I fear causing an inconvenience to them or embarrasing
        myself by having such a *simple* issue.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h3>
      <p>
        They all come down to accountability and social responsibility in the
        coding process. Programming is a very social-reliant practice as it
        involves a variety of parties all working towards one overall goal.
        Values, empathy and self-awareness all create an environment optimised
        for development, troubleshooting and motivation.
      </p>
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Knowing of a concept is not enough, it is the reemergence of the
        concepts in practice that cause positive lasting change. I have
        familiarised myself with many mindsets and psychology terms but reading
        about it and living it are very different things, knowledge can you to
        understand but experience is what teaches you how to react.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Taking the time to analyse myself and write it down, it is often done in
        my head for no one else to take notice of. When writing it down, it
        seems much more real and forces me to fully articulate my thoughts as
        opposed to a thought where I just imply many things without truly
        processing it.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Coding in general needs to be social to some extent, it can be
        frustrating which can lead to a lot of self doubt but personal and
        social understanding encourages us to learn healthier habits.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
        waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
        programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h3>
      <p>
        I definitely do not think it is a waste of time. They allowed helthy
        habits to be fresh in my mind which made it easier to find solutions to
        my problems like forcing myself to ask for help if I needed it. It also
        gave a break in between coding which I feel would have become too
        overwhelming without the breathers in between. In saying that, at some
        points I would find myself becoming more fustrated with the Human Skills
        tasks the personal aspect and articulation of my thoughts and feelings
        can sometimes require more mental effort than coding (coding can be
        troubleshooted but thoughts and feelings are rather unique, involving
        high levels of introspection).
